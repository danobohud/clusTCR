For each combination of properties, a clustering is made 6 times and timed.
This process is repeated 3 times and the fastest time is recorded.

The following times are for clustering a dataset of 32500 TCR's 6 times

basicity: 9.67s
helicity: 12.15s
hydrophobicity: 13.78s
basicity + helicity: 23.91s
basicity + hydrophobicity: 23.95s
helicity + hydrophobicity: 22.52s
basicity + helicity + hydrophobicity: 31.91s
