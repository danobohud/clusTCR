For each combination of properties, a clustering is made 1 times and timed.
This process is repeated 1 times and the fastest time is recorded.

The following times are for clustering a dataset of 32500 TCR's 1 times

basicity: 1.90s
helicity: 1.93s
hydrophobicity: 1.92s
basicity + helicity: 2.60s
basicity + hydrophobicity: 2.60s
helicity + hydrophobicity: 3.32s
basicity + helicity + hydrophobicity: 6.01s
